# Data Center PUE Prediction Tool

A simple simulation tool for *world-wide analysis* of data centers energy performace (power usage effectiveness);
  
  A robust simulation tool for *large-scale global analysis*, low demanding on computional resources, without sacrificing prediction accuracy;

  Support effective PUE target-setting;


  
# PUE estimation for hyperscale data centers

1. Hyperscale data centers with airside economizer + adiabatic cooling
2. Hyperscale data centers utilizing evaporative cooling capability of cooling towers (waterside economizer)
3. Hyperscale data centers with seawater cooling (waterside economizer)


# Under development

1. world-wide PUE analysis for non-hyperscale data centers
2. world-wide analysis of water usage effectiveness (WUE)
3. world-wide analysis of carbon usage effectiveness (CUE)
