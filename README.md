# Data Center PUE Prediction Tool

* A simple simulation tool for *world-wide analysis* of data centers energy performace (power usage effectiveness);
  
* A robust simulation tool for *large-scale global analysis*, low demanding on computational resource, without sacrificing prediction accuracy;

* Physics-based model support *national-level scenario analysis*;

* Support effective *PUE target-setting* according to Climate Zone.


  
# PUE predition for hyperscale data centers

* Hyperscale data centers with airside economizer + adiabatic cooling
* Hyperscale data centers utilizing evaporative cooling capability of cooling towers (waterside economizer)
* Hyperscale data centers with seawater cooling (waterside economizer)


# Under-development

* World-wide PUE analysis for non-hyperscale data centers
* World-wide analysis of water usage effectiveness (WUE)
* World-wide analysis of carbon usage effectiveness (CUE)
